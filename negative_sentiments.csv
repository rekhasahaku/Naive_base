"Overall, the phone isn't too bad for the price. It came already scratched up, overheats more than a normal iPhone (I've had tons of iPhones). The delivery process of just getting the phone was pretty stressful, I'm a month and half in using the iPhone and I called customer service to see if they could replace my iphone because it got to the point where my hands feel the burning from the phone... the lady was so unhelpful, bland and kind of rude. The return proccess would be such a hassle and leave me phoneless so I decided to keep the phone instead. All the functions work fine, it's just that the iphone started heating up the moment I got it. I don't usually write reviews no matter how good or bad a product is, but I've never received such bad service from a company, especially amazon sellers. I'm basically stuck with the phone, or be phoneless. I would recommend the phone, but just know there will definitely some things you need to deal with. HAVE A NICE DAY TO WHOEVER IS READING :)"
"The iPhone 7 I purchased was ""certified refurbished"" and labeled as ""new"" quality but doesn't work. The phone looks great, but when I first turned it on it was in a restart loop. This was a bad sign to begin with, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and connected it to my computer. When I finally got it to restore to factory settings, the screen started glitching to the point where there was nothing to stop it, and if it did get to the startup screen, it was non-responsive."
"Initially I was happy with the phone. It looked great physically and had no signs of wear and tear. However, the battery health was lower than I wanted; the phone said the battery health was 88%. However, I knew from the ad, that it could ship with as low as 85%, so I can't complain too much about that. The biggest issue with the phone that was an absolute deal breaker was that it frequently crashed and closed apps on me. Other times it would freeze up. Imagine having an emergency and having to make a phone call, only to find out that your phone decided to freeze up?! I have a family, so that's completely unacceptable. The phone also seemed to have connectivity issues and would not connect well with my wifi. It was slower than my other devices on my wifi and would sometimes freeze up. With the problems that I was having, I'm thinking it was a bad main board or ""motherboard"". The seller was MobileSpree. I contacted them and asked for an exchange. They refused to do an exchange and said my only option was to return it. I returned it with the shipping label provided by Amazon. However, even after 5 days of having the phone back, they would not refund my money. I had to get Amazon involved to get a refund. Overall, don't buy. It was a waste of time and money and a hassle to get refunded."
"Be cautious - if you have ANY issues at all, return phone immediately. We got one for my daughter, paid $244 and it didn?t last 4 months. Seller will not replace/return as it is past 90 days. She had intermittent issues with service connections shortly after receiving the phone. When it finally stopped connecting at all and we had it checked at the AT&T store, they told us it was an internal issue with the SIM card brackets that connects to the mother board. Basically causing a fatal error and cannot get any service connection. I contacted the seller and received the generic ?past the 90 day warranty? so there is nothing they will do about it. We may try to have it repaired, but the repair shop is looking at $100 to inspect and possibly repair, if it can be repaired. I guess that?s our expensive mistake, but at least we can warn others."
