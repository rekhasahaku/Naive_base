"The phone arrived in pretty decent condition. The front screen was scratch-free and the display is great, but there is a long scratch on the back of the phone. This doesn't bother me much because I always have a case on my phone. However, the issue with this phone is that the cellular signal won't work; the device detects the sim but the signal is bad. Apparently this is an issue with some iPhone 7 models, but the any free of charge repair is not valid because the phone is coming from a third party seller. After speaking with Apple, Verizon (my mobile carrier), AND Amazon, I've reached the conclusion that the issue is with the phone. I've tried everything to troubleshoot, but I will unfortunately have to return the item and get another one.",
"iPhone 7 Black came in excellent condition. Like new. No scratches or scuffs. Works great. Was happy for couple months until phone started to develop issues with hearing callers and vs versa. Callers can’t hear me and I can’t hear callers, the sound is bad. Checked settings . Disabled WiFi calling. Hard reset phone. Updated iOS. Happens randomly. Suspect possible known defects on iPhone 7 with audio IC chips. I want to return the phone but I’m waiting to se for a month",
